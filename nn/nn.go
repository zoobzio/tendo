// Package nn provides neural network building blocks built on tendo tensors.
//
// This package contains reusable layer abstractions for building neural networks:
//   - Linear: fully connected layers
//   - Attention: multi-head self-attention
//   - MLP: feed-forward networks
//   - Transformer: complete transformer layers
